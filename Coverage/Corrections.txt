1)  I had to change the packages of both .java files to edu.nmsu.cs.scoring. this was the only way jacoco would work properly

2)  In RacingScore2, i had to change 

		else if (score2 < score1 && score2 < score3) {
			s1 = score1;
			s2 = score2;
		} //end else if

    to 

		else if (score2 < score1 && score2 < score3) {
			s1 = score1;
			s2 = score3;
		} //end else if
    because the output was not correct

3)  In RacingScore2, I changed

        else {
			s1 = 99;
			s2 = 99;
		} //end else
    
    to

    	else {
			s1 = score1;
			s2 = score2;
		} //end else

    because the output should be the sum of any two of the 3 inputs as if the program gets to this point, it means all 3 inputs are equal. 

4) I dont believe it is possible to set args to null with an ant file. Therefore i was only able to get 96% on RacingScore2.
